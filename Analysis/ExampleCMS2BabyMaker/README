Analysis Tutorial - CMS2 baby-maker and Z-peak analysis
Basic instructions for use


To compile the code:
$ scram b -j20

To create the babies:
$ ./scripts/create_babies_all.sh

To analyze the babies, and make basic plots of m_ll, acceptance, etc.:
$ cd classfiles/
$ root doAll_analyze.C

(other of the doAll/ScanChain pairs do slightly different things, e.g. make event lists)
